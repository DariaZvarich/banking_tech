Banking Tech test
-----------------

 # 1 Approached designing solution to the problem.

    ## 1. Describe the Problem:

        Create a simplified Node.js banking application that allows for deposits, withdrawals, and statement printing in a table format. 
        It should handle errors, maintain transaction history, and serve as a coding exercise or assessment tool.

    ## 2. Design the Class and Methods:

        Planning and Design:

            - Used a Design Recipe with diagrams.
            - Broke down requirements into User Stories.
            - Carefully designed classes with functions.
            - Planned Unit and Integration Tests for behavior verification.

 # 2 Description of the code structure.
        To plan and design this program I used a Design Recipe. To see more description look at 
        /lib/designRecipe.md


 # 3 Description how to install and run code and tests.

    ## 1. Code installation:
        * code projec trepository to your local machine:

            `git clone https://github.com/DariaZvarich/banking_tech.git`
            `cd banking_tech `
            
        * Install:

            `npm install `

     ## 2. Run tests:

            `npm test`

    ## 3. Run code:
         * open a node instance : `node`
         * load the banking class `.load lib/bank.js`
         * try to use the methods on the class
